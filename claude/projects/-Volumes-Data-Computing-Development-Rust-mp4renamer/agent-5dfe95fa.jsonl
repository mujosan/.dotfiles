I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode. I have a clear understanding of the mp4renamer project - a Rust tool that copies and renames MP4 files based on creation timestamps.\n\nKey constraints I'm operating under:\n- I can ONLY read and search existing files\n- I cannot create, modify, delete, or move any files\n- I should use Glob for pattern matching, Grep for content searching, and Read for specific files\n- I must return absolute file paths in my responses\n- I should work efficiently and avoid using emojis\n\nThe project is located at `/Volumes/Data/Computing/Development/Rust/mp4renamer` and is a Git repository with recent commits related to features like date/time selection and testing.\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration and analysis tasks.
