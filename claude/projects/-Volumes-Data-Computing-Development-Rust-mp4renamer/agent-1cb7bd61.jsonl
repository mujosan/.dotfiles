I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore the mp4renamer codebase. \n\nI understand this is a Rust CLI tool that copies and renames MP4 files based on their creation timestamps. Key details from the CLAUDE.md:\n\n- **Main functionality**: Copies MP4s from source to destination, renaming them with format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.MP4`\n- **Language**: Rust (2024 edition)\n- **Key dependencies**: clap (CLI parsing), chrono (date/time handling)\n- **Main file**: `/Volumes/Data/Computing/Development/Rust/mp4renamer/src/main.rs`\n\nI'm currently in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can only search and analyze code, not modify files. I have access to tools for:\n- Searching files with Glob patterns\n- Searching code content with Grep\n- Reading specific files\n- Running read-only Bash operations\n\nThe repo shows `Makefile.toml` has been modified, with recent commits including features for time and date selection, and tests added.\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or analyze in the codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1899,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":277,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVqWyYUdUtkASiLNXJabj","type":"assistant","uuid":"2a3b2015-643f-4cd5-bd41-f460370ea957","timestamp":"2025-12-06T13:32:28.554Z"}
