I've examined the codebase and understand:\n\n1. **Current Architecture**: A straightforward CLI tool that copies and renames MP4 files based on timestamps\n2. **Recent Changes**: Added Makefile, tests, time/date selection features, and immutable file flag handling\n3. **Code Structure**: Main application logic in `src/main.rs` with helper functions for file processing\n4. **Build System**: Uses cargo-make with a Makefile.toml for task automation\n\n**What I Can Do for You:**\n- Explore the codebase in detail (read files, search patterns, trace dependencies)\n- Design implementation plans for new features\n- Analyze architecture and suggest improvements\n- Identify patterns and conventions to follow\n- Map out dependencies and integration points\n\n**What I Cannot Do:**\n- Write or modify any files\n- Create new files or directories\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Execute builds, tests, or installations\n\nPlease provide your requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply, and I'll create a detailed implementation plan based on thorough exploration of the codebase."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2026,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2026},"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVrJebfCYvo9DQFFne43s","type":"assistant","uuid":"3ccaa8a1-20f4-48ce-bc85-8426375f4b86","timestamp":"2025-12-06T23:31:32.374Z"}
